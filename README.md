# 📡 University Network Project - Cisco Packet Tracer

This project presents a simulated university network infrastructure designed in Cisco Packet Tracer as part of the Computer Networks – CSCE353 course at the University of Hail.

The network is designed to provide a scalable, secure, and efficient environment for students, faculty, and administrative staff. It demonstrates key networking concepts such as IP addressing, routing, VLAN segmentation, and centralized network services.

🌐 Key Features
🔁 Scalable Architecture: A structured design that connects all university units, allowing for future expansion.

🗂️ VLAN Implementation: Departmental segmentation using VLANs to enhance security and traffic management.

📨 Centralized Services: DNS, DHCP, Email, and Web servers configured for unified management.

🔒 Secure Internet Access: Proper access control and routing to provide protected connectivity.

📶 Interdepartmental Communication: Smooth and secure communication between faculties and offices.

🛜 Reliable Routing & Switching: Efficient traffic flow and minimized failure points.

📂 Shared Resource Access: Printers and services available to authorized users.

🎯 Learning Objectives
Design and simulate a real-world campus network.

Apply concepts of IP subnetting, VLANs, and dynamic/static routing.

Use Cisco CLI to configure routers and switches.

Implement centralized services for a multi-user environment.

🛠 Tools Used:
Cisco Packet Tracer
